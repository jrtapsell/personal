On the 18th of March, 2017 the University of Cambridge organised a cyber security challenge, with competitors from univerites across the UK. I took part as
    part of the team <b>Buffer Underrun</b>. The final leaderboard has not been released, but when the leaderboard was hidden (1 hour before the end), we were in
    the top 10, despite being a team of 2 against teams of 4.

    The organisers created the following video after the event.
