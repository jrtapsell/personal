During the summer of 2018, I took part in a research project with the **ISG Smart Card and IoT Security Centre**, the
project was titled: **Data Provenance for Multi-Database Servers Enterprise Architecture**.

This project built upon my earlier project undertaken as part of the UROP 2017 at the SCC. The output of that project resulted in a way to make data provenance for a single MongoDB instance. Building on top of that project, this project designed the data provenance collection framework for MongoDB deployed as a cluster. Overall the aims of the project are as below:

-   Collection in clustered environments.
-   Low overhead to the overall cluster
-   No single point of failure
-   Provenance collection and storage for the whole of cluster

This project also created a system for automatically scaling up a MongoDB cluster using modified MongoDB executables, which
allowed for easy testing, but can be reused for other projects.

The poster created for this project which was shown at the ISG open day is included below.
