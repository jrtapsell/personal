I applied for the **Google Europe Scholarship for Students with Disabilities** scholarship, and was accepted.

Google said the following quote about the scholarships on their website:

> Here at Google, we recognize the challenges faced by underrepresented students in the tech industry. We strive to make education more accessible by creating programs to engage students around the world. As part of our initiatives focused on expanding diversity, we offer academic scholarships and a trip to a Google office to learn more about our company and culture, network with a community of fellow scholars, and participate in professional development opportunities. Our goal is to not only support their academic pursuits, but also empower scholars to encourage and inspire others.

This will be a great oportunity, and I look forward to it.
